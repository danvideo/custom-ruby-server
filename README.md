#Ruby TCP Server Quick Challenge (W)
-
### Goal is to create a Ruby TCP Server that returns client IP Address in Morse Code
- Added a few other things: regular ip, headers, server lists connections, etc...
- Morse dictionary included
- TODO: haven't included error handling

### To start server: 
`ruby custom-server.rb PORT_HERE` & `curl localhost:port` in a 2nd term.
